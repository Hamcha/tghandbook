In the real world, criminal law is everything that you will get sued over by the state, such as murder. Civil law is everything that you get sued over by a private party, for instance, slander. On the station, this translates as follows:\n</p><p><b>Criminal Law:</b> Everything that is explicitly against <a href=\"/wiki/Space_Law\" title=\"Space Law\">Space Law</a>. These cases are prepared for entirely in-house by the Security and Command departments, and typically involve crimes against the crew, the station or <a href=\"/wiki/Nanotrasen\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nanotrasen\">Nanotrasen</a> itself.\n</p><p><b>Civil Law:</b> Everything not covered explicitly by Space Law, or that is simply not high profile enough for Security. For example, if the <a href=\"/wiki/Clown\" title=\"Clown\">Clown</a>'s bike horn is stolen by the <a href=\"/wiki/Janitor\" title=\"Janitor\">Janitor</a>, the Clown can try to sue the Janitor. If the <a href=\"/wiki/Curator\" title=\"Curator\">Curator</a> is spreading slander about the <a href=\"/wiki/Quartermaster\" title=\"Quartermaster\">Quartermaster</a>, they may get sued over that by the QM.

Here are a few examples.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bench_Trial_System\">Bench Trial System</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/index.php?title=Guide_to_trials&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=4\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: Bench Trial System\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/index.php?title=Guide_to_trials&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Bench Trial System\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>If you've played any of the Ace Attorney games, you know exactly how this style of trial is performed. The key word is <i>speed</i>; this trial system is designed to counter the problems with endless trials that drag on forever, and to process criminals rapidly.\n</p><p>In a Bench Trial, there is no jury. The Prosecution and Defence start with their opening statements, usually reinforced by presenting some basic evidence. At this point, one of both sides will usually call a Witness to the stand. The Witness is always fetched by the Bailiff and their subordinates. At the stand they give their testimony, which is then <i>cross-examined</i>; what this means is that the Defence and Prosecution may point out contradictions in the testimony, or ask the Witness to clarify parts.\n</p><p>The goal for both sides is to convince the Judge of the verdict that benefits them, Guilty for the Prosecution and Not Guilty for the Defence. Once the trial has progressed to a point where there are no mysteries remaining and no evidence or Witnesses left the Judge will deliver this verdict, thus concluding the trial.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Jury_System\">Jury System</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/index.php?title=Guide_to_trials&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=5\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: Jury System\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/index.php?title=Guide_to_trials&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Jury System\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>If a Jury is present at a trial, they will decide on the verdict instead of the Judge. During the trial, the Jury must be kept separate from the rest of the crew, and be granted plenty of private time to discuss the case. The trial will not end until all members of the Jury vote for the same verdict.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Trial_by_Combat\">Trial by Combat</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/index.php?title=Guide_to_trials&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=6\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: Trial by Combat\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/index.php?title=Guide_to_trials&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Trial by Combat\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>This type of trial completely bypasses all legal systems and is a test of strength between the Defence and the Prosecution. It's simply a fight in which the victorious party decides the verdict. If you want to perform this type of trial, ensure that all involved parties agree and <b>get admin approval</b>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Court_Martial\">Court Martial</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/index.php?title=Guide_to_trials&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=7\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: Court Martial\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/index.php?title=Guide_to_trials&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Court Martial\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Court Martial is mostly performed during Code Red situation where you can't have a normal trial. In this kind of court there is no Defense and only Defendant, the Jury must consist of 2 <a href=\"/wiki/Command_Staff\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Command Staff\">heads</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Security_Officer\" title=\"Security Officer\">officer's</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Captain\" title=\"Captain\">Captain</a>. Process can be overseen by <a href=\"/wiki/Lawyer\" title=\"Lawyer\">Lawyer</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/HoP\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"HoP\">HoP</a>.\n</p><p>The trial starts with prosecution stating charges to the Defendant, showing evidence. After this, Defendant have limited amount of time (in really dire situations can be about 3 minutes) to defend himself. In the end Jury must make a decision, in Court Martial it's usually execution.\n</p><p>Please note that such form of Trial can be seen totalitarian by some, and doing it outside of Red Alert might cause anger in crew.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mistrial\">Mistrial</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/index.php?title=Guide_to_trials&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=8\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: Mistrial\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/index.php?title=Guide_to_trials&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Mistrial\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A <i>mistrial</i> occurs when a trial violates the right procedures. If a mistrial is sustained, the trial ends before a verdict is declared. This does not mean the case is closed, however. Instead, a <i>retrial</i> will be necessary to reach a verdict. A few of the most common causes of a mistrial:\n</p><p><b>Conflict of Interests:</b> If the Judge or a member of the Jury is directly involved in the case, they may be incapable of delivering an impartial verdict. If the Prosecutor has something to gain with a Not Guilty verdict or the Defence Attorney with a Guilty verdict, they are incapable of carrying out their assigned job.\n</p><p><b>Hung Jury:</b> No, not that kind of hung. If the Jury fails to reach a verdict even after a reasonable amount of time, the trial might go on indefinitely.\n</p><p><b>Tampering:</b> If external influence has been exercised on the Judge or the Jury, for instance, bribery or extortion, they will lose their impartiality. Murder falls under Absence.\n</p><p><b>Misconduct:</b> If someone present in the Court Room behaves in such a way that it prevents due process, the trial cannot proceed normally. For example when the courtroom suddenly explodes.\n</p><p><b>Absence:</b> If one or more people vital to the proceedings are missing, such as either attorney or a Judge, the trial cannot proceed normally. It might be a good idea to double-check the crew monitor and morgue.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Double_Jeopardy\">Double Jeopardy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/index.php?title=Guide_to_trials&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=9\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: Double Jeopardy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/index.php?title=Guide_to_trials&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Double Jeopardy\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><b>You cannot be prosecuted twice for the same crime.</b> This is called <i>double jeopardy</i>, and it is an important principle in the legal world. Although it means that in theory, once you've been found not guilty for a crime you can never be tried for it again, in practice, you can be retried if new evidence surfaced since the verdict that sheds new light on the case. The reverse holds too; if you were found guilty of a crime, but new evidence may prove your innocence, you can also get retried... Unless you've been executed and turned into burgers, of course.\n</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF\">\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<td colspan=\"9\"
